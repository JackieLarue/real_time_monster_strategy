The main point of my mechanics is to facilitate creating chains of actions called "moves". 
These allow the player to "program" the actions their monsters can take during battle. 
Not in an automated way however. The player must manually choose in battle what moves 
to call out for their monster to act upon on the fly, to create a dynamic of both strategy 
and in the moment thinking.
